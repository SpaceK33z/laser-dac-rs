Unified DAC backend abstraction for laser projectors.

This crate provides a complete solution for communicating with various laser DAC hardware:

- **Discovery**: Automatically find connected DAC devices (USB and network)
- **Workers**: Background threads for non-blocking frame output
- **Backends**: Unified `DacBackend` trait for all DAC types

This crate does not apply any additional processing on points (like blanking), except to make it compatible with the target DAC.

⚠️ **Warning**: use at your own risk! Laser projectors can be dangerous.

## Supported DACs

| DAC                        | Connection | Features | Verified |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | -------- |
| Helios                     | USB        | 12-bit   | ✅       |
| Ether Dream                | Network    | 16-bit   | ✅       |
| IDN (ILDA Digital Network) | Network    | 16-bit   | ✅       |
| LaserCube WiFi             | WiFi       | 16-bit   | ❌       |
| LaserCube USB / Laserdock  | USB        | 12-bit   | ✅       |

The DACs that are not verified, I have not tested with the DAC itself yet. Help to test these would be very welcome!

## Quick Start

Connect your laser DAC and run an example. For full API details, see the [documentation](https://docs.rs/laser-dac).

```bash
cargo run --example high_level -- circle
# or:
cargo run --example high_level -- triangle
```

The examples run continuously until you press Ctrl+C.

## Discovery Behavior

There are two discovery APIs:

- `DacDiscoveryWorker` continuously scans in a background thread and auto-connects to new devices, yielding ready-to-use `DacWorker` instances.
- `DacDiscovery` is manual: you call `scan()` and decide if/when to `connect()` each `DiscoveredDevice`.

`DacDiscoveryWorker` runs a background thread that:

1. **Scans periodically** (default: every 2 seconds, configurable via `discovery_interval()`) for new devices across all enabled DAC types
2. **Reports all discovered devices** via `poll_discovered_devices()` regardless of filter
3. **Auto-connects to filtered devices** and yields ready-to-use workers via `poll_new_workers()`
4. **Automatic reconnection** - when a device connection fails, it's removed from tracking and will reconnect on the next scan

Multiple devices of the same type are supported - each is identified by a unique name (MAC address for Ether Dream, serial number for LaserCube, etc.)

You can provide a device filter predicate to control which devices are auto-connected:

```rust
use laser_dac::{DacDiscoveryWorker, DacType, EnabledDacTypes};
use std::time::Duration;

let discovery = DacDiscoveryWorker::builder()
    .enabled_types(EnabledDacTypes::all())
    .device_filter(|info| info.dac_type == DacType::EtherDream)
    .discovery_interval(Duration::from_secs(1))
    .build();

// All discovered devices are visible, even those not matching the filter
for device in discovery.poll_discovered_devices() {
    println!("Found: {} ({:?})", device.name(), device.dac_type);
}

// Only filtered devices become workers
for worker in discovery.poll_new_workers() {
    println!("Connected: {}", worker.device_name());
}
```

## Coordinate System

All backends use normalized coordinates:

- **X**: -1.0 (left) to 1.0 (right)
- **Y**: -1.0 (bottom) to 1.0 (top)
- **Colors**: 0-65535 for R, G, B, and intensity

Each backend handles conversion to its native format internally.

## Data Types

| Type                 | Description                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `LaserFrame`         | Collection of points + PPS rate                  |
| `LaserPoint`         | Single point with position (f32) and color (u16) |
| `DacType`            | Enum of supported DAC hardware                   |
| `DacDevice`          | Device name + type                               |
| `DacConnectionState` | Connected or Lost state                          |

## Features

By default, all DAC protocols are enabled via the `all-dacs` feature.

| `network-dacs`   | Enable network DACs: `ether-dream`, `idn`, `lasercube-wifi` |
| `helios`         | Helios USB DAC                                              |
| `lasercube-usb`  | LaserCube USB (LaserDock) DAC                               |
| `ether-dream`    | Ether Dream network DAC                                     |

For example, to enable only network DACs:

```toml
[dependencies]
laser-dac = { version = "*", default-features = false, features = ["network-dacs"] }
```

### Other Features

| Feature | Description                                                    |

| `serde` | Enable serde serialization for `DacType` and `EnabledDacTypes` |

### USB DAC Requirements

USB DACs (`helios`, `lasercube-usb`) use [rusb](https://crates.io/crates/rusb) which requires CMake to build.
